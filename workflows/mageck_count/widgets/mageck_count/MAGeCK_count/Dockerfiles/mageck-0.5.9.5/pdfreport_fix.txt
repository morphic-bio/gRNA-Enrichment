CHANGES FROM ORIGINAL:

--pdf-report should now work. Originally, <sample>.count_normalized.txt 
would be read in the .Rnw and .Rmd files via `read.table()`, 
but the tab-delimited format in the .txt would lead to "
Error in scan(file = file, what = what, sep = sep, quote = quote, dec = dec,  
: line 7 did not have 3 elements" error. These files are supposed to be
converted to pdf.
To fix this, `sep = '\t'` argument is added to read.table().

This fix has been applied to the following files:
mageck/count_report.Rmd
mageck/fastq_template.Rnw
(no read.table() in mageck/plot_template.Rnw)
mageck/plot_template.RTemplate
(no read.table() in mageck/plot_template_indvgene.RTemplate)
mageck/test_report.Rmd
